## ✨ Features

> ⚠️ **Currently only one feature is available**. More are planned in future updates.

### ✅ Implemented
- **Sack Tracker**  
  Tracks the amount of items in your sacks and notifies you on changes.  
  Useful for farming and tracking resource progression.

- **Server-side API Key Storage**  
  The Hypixel API key is now **only stored on the server** for increased security and better control.  
  It is never exposed on the client side.

- **Caching System**  
  To reduce load on the Hypixel API and improve performance, the mod includes a caching system  
  that stores recent data and avoids unnecessary requests.

---

## 🛠️ Planned Features
- **Discord Rich Presence Integration**  
  Display custom mod status in Discord (instead of other mods like Badlion, Feather, etc.).

- **Graphical Settings Menu (GUI)**  
  A user-friendly configuration screen to adjust mod behavior and options easily without editing config files.
